# List of dicts with win_dns_records to configure. The dicts have the same
# attributes that the ones expected by the ansible win_dns_records module.
# For example:
#
# win_dns_records:
#   - name: test1
#     type: A
#     value: 1.2.3.4
#     zone: domain.local
#   - name: "4"
#     type: PTR
#     value: test1
#     zone: 3.2.1.in-addr.arpa
#   - name: www.test1
#     type: CNAME
#     value: test1
#     zone: domain.local
